<p> This process is based on test-case. Each test-case is a pair of inputs and outputs.
When the learner/user "click" on the <b>evaluation button</b> it is initiated the code interpretation: <br/>
 when the first command to enter data (<tt>input</tt>) is found, it is used the data on the first input (inside the first test-case);<br/>
 when the second input command (if it exists) is found, the same is done, and so on with all input command;<br/>
 whe the first command to print any data is found (<tt>print</tt>), it is compared with the first output (inside the first test-case),
   if they are equal, one point is registered;<br/>
 when the second print command (if it exists) is found, the same is done, and so on with all output command.<br/>
At the end, the assignment grade is total of point gained divided by the total number of outputs (in the test-case).
