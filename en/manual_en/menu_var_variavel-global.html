<h3>Global Variable</h3>

<p>
The <i>variables</i> are used to store values.
One of them is <i>global variable</i> when it is declared in the <i>main</i> program area (see image).
<br/>
<br/>
It is recommended that <b>avoid using this type of variable</b>, since it can lead to confusion in the code.
It is preferable to use <b>local variable</b>! <!-- use <b>global</b> only if you are sure it is the best solution. -->
<br/>
This type of variable is <b>recognized</b> at any point in your code, that is, 
within any function, you can use this <i>variable as long as <b>no</b> local variable has the same name</i>!

<p>
When you create a global variable, you can configure the following characteristics:
<ol>
<li><b>Const:</b> although it has the variable name, when we define a variable to be constant, it <b>can not</b> have its initial value changed;</li>
<li><b>Type:</b>  defines the type of information that will be stored in the variable (simple types: integer, real, string or logical, vector: any simple type);</li>
<li><b>Name:</b>  defines the name of the variable, used to trigger it from any part of the program;</li>
<li><b>Value:</b> defines the first value to be stored in the variable (initialize the variable).</li>
</ol>
